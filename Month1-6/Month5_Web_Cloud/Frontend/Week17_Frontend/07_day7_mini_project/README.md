# Day 7 – Mini Project: ML Input Form UI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **complete input form UI** built using **HTML, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS**, ready to integrate with a backend ML model. Users can enter data (e.g., health metrics) which will later be sent to a FastAPI or Django backend for prediction.

## Features
- **Responsive Form Layout:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Input Fields:** Includes text, number, radio buttons, and dropdowns.
- **Validation:** Basic HTML5 validation (required fields, min/max values).
- **Submit Button:** Styled using Tailwind and Bootstrap for consistent look.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)
- TailwindCSS (CDN)
- Custom CSS for styling

## How to Run
1. Download the `diabetes_form.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern web browser.
3. Fill in the input fields and click submit. (Currently no backend integration.)
4. Ready for connection to ML API using JavaScript `fetch` or form submission.

## Notes
- Can be adapted for any ML prediction form (e.g., diabetes, BMI, heart disease).
- Designed for smooth integration with FastAPI/Django endpoints.
- Responsive and visually appealing with minimal code.

## Next Steps
- Connect form to ML backend.
- Add error handling & feedback on submission.
- Optional: Integrate JavaScript to display predictions dynamically.
