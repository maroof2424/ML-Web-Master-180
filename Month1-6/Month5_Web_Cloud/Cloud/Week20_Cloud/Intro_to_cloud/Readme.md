# **🌥️ Day 1 – Cloud Basics Intro**

**Goal:** Understand the basics of cloud computing and explore free platforms for hosting ML models and web apps.

---

## **1️⃣ What is Cloud?**

* Cloud = Servers + storage + apps hosted on the Internet.
* Instead of running everything locally, your code and models are **hosted online**.
* Benefits: Access from anywhere, scalable, shareable, free for small projects.

---

## **2️⃣ Why Use Cloud for ML / Web Apps?**

* ML models can be heavy → local machines can be slow.
* Cloud allows hosting **backend + frontend** → accessible to anyone online.
* Free tiers allow small apps to run without cost (student-friendly).

## **4️⃣ Core Concepts**

1. **S3 / Storage** → Upload datasets, files, or models.
2. **Lambda / Functions** → Run serverless code without managing servers.
3. **EC2 / Compute** → Full backend server in the cloud.
4. **App Engine / Deployment** → Make your app accessible online.

---

## **5️⃣ Key Tips**

* Start by deploying **small projects** → helps build confidence.
* Always use **free student-friendly platforms** → no credit card needed.
* Integrate **GitHub + Cloud deployment** → best practice for versioning and updates.
