# 📘 Day 1 – Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)

Central tendency refers to a **single value** that tries to describe a dataset by identifying the **center point**.
The three main measures are **Mean, Median, and Mode**.

---

## 1️⃣ Mean (Average)

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

### Example:

Dataset = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{2+4+6+8+10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

✅ The average is **6**.

---

## 2️⃣ Median

The **median** is the middle value when the data is arranged in order.

* If `n` is **odd** → middle value.
* If `n` is **even** → average of two middle values.

### Example 1 (Odd count):

Dataset = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
Median = 7 (middle value).

### Example 2 (Even count):

Dataset = {2, 4, 6, 8}
Median = (4+6)/2 = 5.

✅ The median is **5**.

---

## 3️⃣ Mode

The **mode** is the most frequent value in the dataset.

### Example:

Dataset = {2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9}

* Most frequent value = 7

✅ Mode = **7**

## 🔑 When to Use?

* **Mean** → Best for normal, symmetric data (no outliers).
* **Median** → Better for skewed data or when outliers exist.
* **Mode** → Best for categorical or discrete data (e.g., favorite color, shoe size).

## ✅ Practice Problems

1. Find mean, median, mode of: {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
2. A dataset of salaries: {20k, 22k, 21k, 1,000k} → Compare mean vs median.
   (Hint: Mean will be skewed by the outlier salary).
