# 📊 Week 6 – Probability & Statistics

This week covers the **foundations of statistics and probability** essential for Data Science & Machine Learning.

## 🗓️ Day-wise Plan

### ✅ Day 1 – Central Tendency
- Concepts: Mean, Median, Mode
- When to use which measure
- 📘 Notebook: `01_central_tendency.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Variance & Standard Deviation
- Spread of data
- Population vs Sample variance
- 📘 Notebook: `02_variance_std.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Probability
- Basics of probability (events, sample space)
- Independent & dependent events
- Conditional probability
- 📘 Notebook: `03_probability.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Normal Distribution
- Gaussian distribution curve
- Properties of bell curve
- Applications in real datasets
- 📘 Notebook: `04_normal_distribution.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Z-scores & p-values
- Z-score (standardization)
- p-value meaning & significance level
- Relation to hypothesis testing
- 📘 Notebook: `05_z_pvalues.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Hypothesis Testing
- Null & Alternate hypotheses
- Type I and Type II errors
- t-test, chi-square, ANOVA (intro)
- 📘 Notebook: `06_hypothesis.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Day 7 – Mini Project
- Perform **statistical analysis** on any dataset (e.g., Titanic, Netflix, FIFA)
- Steps:
  - Find central tendency & spread
  - Check distribution & normality
  - Run hypothesis test
- 📘 Notebook: `07_mini_project.ipynb`

## 🎯 Weekly Goal
By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand **statistics foundations**
- Apply **probability concepts**
- Perform **basic hypothesis testing**
- Be ready to use these tools in **ML preprocessing & evaluation**
