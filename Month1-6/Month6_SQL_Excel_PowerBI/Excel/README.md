## **Day 1 – Formulas & Functions**

* **Focus:** SUM, AVERAGE, IF, nested IFs, VLOOKUP.
* **Advice:**

  1. Start by practicing basic arithmetic formulas.
  2. Use **IF** for conditional logic. Try nested IFs to understand complex conditions.
  3. **VLOOKUP:** key for searching values. Understand how the `range_lookup` TRUE/FALSE works.
* **Tip:** Always use **absolute references (`$A$1`)** when dragging formulas—avoid wrong calculations.

## **Day 2 – Lookup & Reference**

* **Focus:** INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP
* **Advice:**

  1. MATCH finds a row/column number; INDEX retrieves value. Combine them for dynamic lookups.
  2. XLOOKUP is newer & more powerful than VLOOKUP (handles left-lookups, exact match default).
* **Practice:** Replace VLOOKUP formulas with XLOOKUP and INDEX+MATCH in your dataset.

## **Day 3 – Conditional Formatting**

* **Focus:** Highlight data based on rules (e.g., top 10 sales, negative numbers).
* **Advice:**

  1. Use **formula-based rules** for advanced logic.
  2. Combine with data bars/color scales for dashboards.
* **Practice:** Highlight all customers with sales > $10,000 in green and < $5,000 in red.

## **Day 4 – Charts**

* **Focus:** Column, Line, Pie, Combo
* **Advice:**

  1. Use **Combo charts** for comparing two metrics with different scales (like sales vs profit margin).
  2. Always **label axes and legends**—dashboard clarity > fancy colors.
* **Tip:** Keep chart simple; avoid clutter.

## **Day 5 – PivotTables Basics**

* **Focus:** Summarize large datasets quickly.
* **Advice:**

  1. Drag fields to **Rows, Columns, Values, Filters** and see changes dynamically.
  2. PivotTables are your best friend for fast aggregation.
* **Practice:** Count sales per region, average revenue per salesperson.

## **Day 6 – PivotTables Advanced**

* **Focus:** Slicers, filters, grouping, calculated fields.
* **Advice:**

  1. Group dates into months/quarters for trends.
  2. Slicers = interactive filters → key for dashboards.
* **Tip:** Always test calculations manually for accuracy.

## **Day 7 – Mini Project**

* **Focus:** Build a **Sales/Customer Analytics Dashboard**
* **Advice:**

  1. Combine formulas, PivotTables, charts, conditional formatting.
  2. Use **named ranges** for better formula readability.
  3. Keep design clean; dashboards should be **interactive and readable**.
* **Dataset suggestion:** Sales data with Date, Region, Product, Sales Amount, Customer Segment.
